# UTAUMassEnvelopeEditor
This is a program that allows the user to have each note in their .ust file have the exact same envelopes.

## Installation
Install this plugin the way you would install any other plugin: download the "UTAU Mass Envelope Editor plugin" folder from the file list above and place it in your UTAU plugins directory. 

## Running the program
Open UTAU and select the range of notes you would like to change the envelopes for. Make sure the first note in this range has the desired envelope you want all of the other notes in the selected range to share. ![alt text](file:///C:/Users/azure/Downloads/unedited.png)
